# My_Sokoban

My_sokoban was a 2 weeks project. This program uses the ncurses librairy in order to be a little terminal game.
Its objectif is to put every X on the O.
In order to try it, use make and then ./my_sokoban map_name.
You can also try to go in the bonus folder, use make and then ./my_sokoban_bonus map_name to try it with the CSFML lib.
Have fun !
